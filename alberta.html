                  It was such a nice drive. I managed to sneak myself behind the wheel and take over for a little bit. The landscape was so nice and I am really thankful to be able to enjoy it on the front seat.

                 The germans drove to the next farm (Moose Mountain farm) they did trail riding and our guide was from the UK. she told us a lot about her and what she did so far. The ride was great our father sat the first time on a horse and it was pretty impressive how good he was.
