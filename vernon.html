                  The day started slow (Mirja, Jonna and Jens(our father)) went for a quick dip into the ocean before we left. We packed up and left for Whistler. We drove thru Nanaimo hoped on the ferry to Horseshoe Bay and from there by car to Whistler. On the 24th of May we drove 500km thru the mountains to Vernon. On the way we encountered a bear and saw amazing landscape.

                  We visited Emily, who is a host Jonna stayed with for a while. Emily showed us around her farm and that she got piglets. After the farm tour we were invited to join for dinner. Emily told us a lot about the Canada which was really interesting.

                  On a Sunday we went to the church and were invited to soup from an older Dutch couple which was pretty amazing they have a log house which was the first log house I went to in and it was astonishing. The Evening we went up to silver star a know ski place for hiking and some of us just wanted to grab a coffee and chill sadly all the places were closed on the weekends so the people who didn’t want to hike couldn’t grab a coffee. For dinner we dined at browns Socialhouse Village Green and met a older German couple who immigrated when they were younger. We were about to leave the place but the men pick up that we are German so he started talking to us in German and we a nice conversation.
