                  The day slow, the girls and dad decided to go for a quick dip into the ocean before we left for whilster. We drove through Nanaimo hoped on the ferry to Horseshoe Bay and from there to Whistler. On the 24th of May we drove 500km through the mountains and eventually got to Vernon. On the way we saw amazing landscapes and our first a bear which was definitely a highlight.

                  We visited Emily, who is a host Jonna stayed with for a while. Emily showed us around her farm and her only day old piglets, super cute when they are small but the adult pigs where very much impressive to say the least. After the  farm tour, we were invited for dinner. While and after dinner Emily told us a lot about the Canada which was really interesting.

                  On a Sunday we went to the church Jonna went to while she stayed at Emilyâ€™s place. And after the service we were invited for soup from an older Dutch couple which was pretty amazing. They had a lot of funny stories and a gorgeous log house which was the first log house I went to in and it was astonishing. 
The Evening we went up to silver star a known ski resort for hiking and some of us just wanted to grab a coffee and chill. Sadly though all the places were closed on the weekends. For dinner we went out to browns Socialhouse Village Green and met a older German couple who immigrated when they were younger. We were about to leave the place but they pick up that we are German so he just started talking to us in German and we had a really great time talking to them. Dad was very moved by the encounter just because of the chances of that happening are so small yet it was pretty perfect timing.
