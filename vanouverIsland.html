                  We went hiking on Vancouver Island to explore the wilderness and enjoy the beauty of nature. The hike was about 3km long and 300m upwards. Even though that doesnâ€™t sound too bad, it was a whole workout but totally worth it. We got rewarded with a beautiful view.

                  We stayed pretty closed to Victoria, the capital of Vancouver Island, so exploring that was definitely on the agenda. It started with a nice breakfast Fuego. It was very tasty and we had an extremely nice waitress who gave us lots of advice for things to do and places to see especially on a rainy day. Most importantly she gave good advice on the parking situation.
So we went shopping, got more information for whale watching and went into the Royal museum. I think everyone exceeded their step goals that day.
