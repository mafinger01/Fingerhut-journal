                  The next day we went whale watching and it was pretty awesome. we got to see an orca school (4, a mother with her kids) and saw humpback whales too. I (Jonna) was making a lot of photos with Mathis phone and he was so anxious that it would fall into the water, it was truely hilarious.
                  After crossing that of our bucket list we went to a sushi restaurant to stay with the theme of seafood. Mathis bravely got raw squid which he realized very soon wasn’t a good choice. So we balanced it out with a Wendy’s burger afterwards.
